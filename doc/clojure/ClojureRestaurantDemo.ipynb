    "the partition criterion. For example, if a visitor enters between 8 AM and 9 AM,\n",
    "they *contribute* to the *8 AM partition*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in the the example above, a visitor can enter the restaurant only\n",
    "once per day. This implies three *contribution bounds*:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   *Maximum partitions contributed*: to how many partitions can a visitor\n",
    "    contribute? In our example, a visitor can contribute up to one partition. In\n",
    "    other words, there is at most one time-slot when a visitor with a given id\n",
    "    can enter the restaurant.\n",
    "*   *Maximum contributed value*: what is the maximum value that can be\n",
    "    contributed by a visitor to a partition? In our example, we count the number\n",
    "    of visits, so the maximum contributed value is simply *1*.\n",
    "*   *Maximum contributions per partition*: how many times can a visitor\n",
    "    contribute to a partition? In our example, a visitor can contribute to a\n",
    "    partition at most once. In other words, a visitor can enter the restaurant\n",
    "    only once at a given hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this important? Differential Privacy adjusts the amount of noise to mask\n",
    "contributions of each visitor. More contributions require more noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will demonstrate how to use the library in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
